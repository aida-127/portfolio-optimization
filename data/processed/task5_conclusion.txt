=========================================
Date: 2026-02-03 13:54:24

BACKTEST RESULTS:
Our Strategy (Max Sharpe Portfolio):
- Final Value: ,970
- Total Return: -0.3%
- Sharpe Ratio: -0.061

Benchmark (60% SPY / 40% BND):
- Final Value: ,703
- Total Return: +7.0%
- Sharpe Ratio: +0.710

CONCLUSION:
The benchmark outperformed our strategy in this backtest period.
The simple 60/40 portfolio delivered better returns.

LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Over-reliance on BND (94%) limited upside potential
2. Simple strategies can outperform complex optimizations
3. Portfolio optimization is sensitive to input assumptions
